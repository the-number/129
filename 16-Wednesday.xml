<para>A view on connections. The present. Decide by Wednesday of what ``time''
to commit to this. We are using it right now. So that commitment exists now.

<para>The possible approaches include a proper work setup. Define the
outcomes and their measures. This will be part of a contract. Time is
included; what will be delivered when. It will have a project plan to
some level of detail. Decide on Wednesday.

<para>Better just call it ``btrfs''. ``B'' for balance, ``tr'' for the trees, it is
a system for filing files and directories and related factoids, ``fs''.
</para>

<ol><li>
Read and understand the user documentation (&THERE_TOO;Main_Page#Guides_and_usage_information).
</li><li>
Create one or several btrfs filesystems with different configurations and learn how they work in userspace 
-- what are the features, what are the problems you see? 
</li><li>
Actually use at least one of the filesystems you created for real data in daily use (with backups)
</li><li>
Build the userspace tools from git
</li><li>
Pick up one of the userspace projects from Project_ideas#Userspace_tools_projects and implement that.
 If you pick the right one(s), you'll have to learn about some of 
 the internal structures of the FS anyway. Compile and test your patch.
</li><li>
If you're adding a new feature, write an automated xfstest for it as well.
Get that patch accepted.
 This will probably involve a sequence of revisions to it, multiple versions over a period of several weeks or more,
 with a review process.
</li><li>
You should also send your test to xfstests and get that accepted.
</li><li>
Do the above again, until you get used to the processes involved,
 and have demonstrated that you can work well with the other people in the subsystem,
 and are generally producing useful and sane code.
</li><li>
It's all about trust -- can you be trusted to mostly do the right thing?
Use the documentation at &THERE_TOO;Main_Page#Developer_documentation, and the output of btrfs-debug-tree to understand the internal structure of the FS
</li><li>
Pick up one of the smaller, more self-contained ideas from the projects page Project_ideas
 (say, &THERE_TOO;Project_ideas#Cancellable_operations or Project_ideas#Implement_new_FALLOC_FL_.2A_modes)
 and try to implement it.
</li><li>
 Again: build, write test code, test thoroughly, submit patch for review, modify as suggested by reviewers, and repeat as often as necessary.
</li>
