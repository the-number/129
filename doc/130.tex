\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} (Backlog refinement) later, the team should review these methods and make choices}
\label{sec:org9b635f1}
\subsection*{Learning and experiences}
\label{sec:org55a440d}
The organisation should benefit from the experiences that are narrated here.
However, the team should agree on a choice of tools/methods/approaches to be
taken forward. The team should then focus only on the selected things. Other
options should be kept options within reach, to facilitate review and reconsidering
options.
\subsection*{This track, B has specific goals and the backlock refinement event should address them}
\label{sec:orgccee0b4}
ATDD. Specify the products by giving concrete examples. Application tests should
drive development forward. This track is about that. Is this agreed?
\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} The developer uses a template to formulate one specific test}
\label{sec:org45cfb33}
\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily INPROGRESS} Find out about ERT}
\label{sec:org8b5d9ee}
How to run the ERT-TEST set.

\begin{verbatim}
emacs -L some-where \
      -l ert \
      -L test \
      -l ert-tests.el \
      -f ert-summarize-tests-batch-and-exit output.log
\end{verbatim}


Oh, how interesting. 24 and 26 \uline{are} different; so it seems.
Does 26 drift towards cl? What about scope; dynamic, lexical\ldots{}
\begin{verbatim}
emacs -L some-where \
 -l ert \
 -L test \
 -l ert-test.el \
 -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit |& tee _/$( date )-ert-tests
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} The stakeholders want to see the difference in lexical and dynamic, or else}
\label{sec:org3f6c1b0}
Is hygiene just about soap, the developers wonder.
They need their curiosity entertained.
Being free. Currying, or so. Again!

\begin{verbatim}
run-ert-24
\end{verbatim}

\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} The developers should gain experience of using these tools}
\label{sec:orgb087038}
Structure templates

\texttt{C-c C-,} the sequence for \texttt{(org-insert-structure-template)}
\begin{verbatim}
(+ 1 101)
\end{verbatim}

What effort this is

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

And this is this! For now.

\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} To produce this, here}
\label{sec:org3070956}
\subsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} The developers' and owner's machines may use directory locals to work this}
\label{sec:orgd11dca9}

\subsubsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} the developer should verify that these things work for \textbf{them}}
\label{sec:org7ea1407}

\begin{verbatim}
((org-mode
  (eval progn (defun all-this ()
					; (org-cycle '(64))
		(org-html-export-to-html)
		(with-current-buffer (htmlize-buffer)
		  (write-file (buffer-name (current-buffer)) nil)
		  (kill-buffer (current-buffer)))
		(defun push-to (a b c)
		  (shell-command
		   (format D
			   a b c)))
		(push-to (file-name-base) ".org.html" C)
		(push-to (file-name-base) ".html" C)
		(push-to (file-name-base) ".org" C)))
  (D . "scp -P 2222 %s%s www2.bteco.ltd.uk:/var/www/html/t/6/%s"))
 ("a/"
  (org-mode
   (C . "a/")))
 ("b/"
  (org-mode
   (C . "b/")))
 ("c/"
  (org-mode
   (C . "c/"))))
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} Now, on some other machine there may be different parameters.}
\label{sec:orge6ffd80}

\begin{verbatim}
((org-mode
  (eval progn (defun push-to (a b c)
     (shell-command
      (format D a b c))))
  (D . "cp -v %s%s /var/www/html/t/4/%s"))
 ("a/"
  (org-mode
   (C . "a/")))
 ("b/"
  (org-mode
   (C . "b/")))
 ("c/"
  (org-mode
   (C . "c/"))))
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily WAITING} The team should verify things for \textbf{their} workstation and \textbf{their} server.}
\label{sec:orgc9ea4a8}

\texttt{C-x \textasciitilde{}C-e} may be hit at the end of each line.

\begin{verbatim}
D
(buffer-name (current-buffer))
C
(all-this)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} On the way to get this done, this is a previous increment}
\label{sec:org787b4cf}

This is here for review. It is currently done via file local variables

Within the source block hit \texttt{C-c C-c} to do all within.
Or, to execute just a single SEXP, hit \texttt{C-x C-e} after it.

Hit \texttt{C-c C-o} to open the following link that does \texttt{(all-this)}.
\href{(all-this)}{\{Do all of this\}} (after \texttt{all-this} if =defun=ed.)

\begin{verbatim}
(defun all-this ()
 "ALL-THIS, exported and htmlized and uploaded.

Note: this works on emacs 26.3. However, emacs 24.2 complains."
 (load-theme 'manoj-dark t nil)                    ;; C-x C-e
 (org-cycle '(64))                                 ;; showeverything
 ; (org-cycle '(4))                                ;; overview
 (org-html-export-to-html)                         ;; .html
 (with-current-buffer (htmlize-buffer) 
  (write-file (buffer-name (current-buffer)) nil)
  (kill-buffer (current-buffer)))                  ;; .org.html
q (defun push-to (a b c)
  "The org-mode basename, A, with extension, B, to its place withing, C"
  (shell-command
   (format
    "scp -P 2222 %s%s www2.bteco.ltd.uk:/var/www/html/t/4/%s"
    a b c)))                                      ;; abstract
 (push-to (file-name-base) ".org.html" "b/")
 (push-to (file-name-base) ".html" "b/")
 (push-to (file-name-base) ".org" "b/"))          ;; push
 (all-this)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
(org-cycle '(4))                                ;; overview
(org-cycle '(64))                               ;; showeverything
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} Another way To produce this, here: \texttt{C-c C-o} over \href{(all-this)}{\{Do all of this\}}}
\label{sec:orgdbf0d3e}

Within the source block hit \texttt{C-c C-c} to do all within.
Or, to execute just a single SEXP, hit \texttt{C-x C-e} after it.

Hit \texttt{C-c C-o} to open the following link that does \texttt{(all-this)}.
\href{(all-this)}{\{Do all of this\}} (after \texttt{all-this} if =defun=ed by the file local variables.)

\begin{verbatim}
(org-cycle '(4))                                ;; overview
(org-cycle '(64))                               ;; showeverything
(a)
(c)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
# Local Variables:
# mode: org
# eval: (progn (defun a ()
#         (format "%s" (buffer-file-name))))
# eval: (progn (defun c ()
#         "b/"))
# eval: (progn (defun all-this ()
#  (org-cycle '(64))
#  (org-html-export-to-html)
#  (with-current-buffer (htmlize-buffer) 
#   (write-file (buffer-name (current-buffer)) nil)
#   (kill-buffer (current-buffer)))
#  (defun push-to (a b c)
#   (shell-command
#    (format
#     "scp -P 2222 %s%s www2.bteco.ltd.uk:/var/www/html/t/4/%s"
#     a b c)))
#  (push-to (file-name-base) ".org.html" (c))
#  (push-to (file-name-base) ".html" (c))
#  (push-to (file-name-base) ".org" (c))))
# End:
\end{verbatim}
\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} This was here, this was the local thing}
\label{sec:org2ecd637}
and now, the last section in this file sets local variables. They facilitate
the making of this.
\begin{verbatim}
(setq lexical-binding t)
;; 
lexical-binding
;; t
(add-file-local-variable 'mode 'org
)
;;
(add-file-local-variable 'mode 'fundamental)
;;
